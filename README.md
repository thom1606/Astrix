Welcome to **Astrix**! Your one-stop solution for easy finder management. This project is meant to help you improve your productivity by providing a simple and easy-to-use finder tool that helps you get into development faster.

## Project Overview

Astrix is a macOS finder extension which adds a button to your finder toolbar. With this button you have the possibility to open that specific folder in your editor/terminal of choice. To get started with Astrix, you can simply open the app, walk through the onboarding and Astrix will be ready in your Finder app.

The application is built using SwiftUI and Swift and is available for macOS 14.0 and above.
